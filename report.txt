Description:
    A chat app for Linux that uses sockets in UNIX Domain and TCP to communicate. 
    There is a main server file that opens the port and the client files can connect 
    to the server.
    
    Once connected, each client can either participate in a group chat or message  
    any connected user personally.
    
    Every time a user connects, he/she is assigned a unique ID by the server which 
    can be used by others to message him personally.
